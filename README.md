# SECR3253 Network Programming Group Assignment

## Project Title
Network Automation and Linux System Information Project

## Project Overview
This project is developed for the SECR3253 Network Programming group assignment. The main purpose of this project is to create a small automation solution using Docker, Ansible, NETCONF, or related automation tools.

The project focuses on automating network device configuration tasks and collecting Linux system information. It is also managed using GitHub to show collaboration and contribution from all group members.

## IP Address and Interface Description Automation

Using Ansible to configure a Cisco IOS network device interface. The playbook will set the interface description, assigns an IPv4 address, enables the interface and also will displays the running config for verification.

Files:
- `device_config/configure_ip_interface.yml`
- `device_config/inventory.example.yml`
- `device_config/person2_sample_output.txt`

Run command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ios
ansible-playbook -i device_config/inventory.example.yml device_config/configure_ip_interface.yml
```

**Before running, update `device_config/inventory.example.yml` with the real device IP address, username, password, and enable password. Update `interface_name`, `interface_ip`, and `interface_netmask` in `device_config/configure_ip_interface.yml` if the test device uses different values.**

## Personal Reflection Report
Each member must prepare a 2-page personal reflection report that includes:

1. Contribution to the project
2. Challenges encountered during collaboration
3. Lessons learned from the project

## Final Deliverables
- GitHub Repository URL
- Completed automation project
- README documentation
- GitHub commit history from all members
- Screenshots or output proof
- Personal reflection report from each member

## Deadline
Submission deadline: 6 July 2026, 9:00 AM
